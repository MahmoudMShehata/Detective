## Description

Nothing is tricky, just hit the main page and you're good to go!
You'll find a search bar and beneath it the top searches done by the users and there's a drop-down menu having the user's own search history. The top searches section gets automatically updated using action cable if there's something trending ðŸ“ˆ
The main algorithm for displaying trendy searches is designed to only show meaningful searches, here's a simple breakdown :

1st search => how is (searched for 15 times and is one of the top searches)
2nd search => how is the weather today (searched for only 1 time)

1st search is taken down from being a top search as "how is the weather today" is a meaningful search so it replaces it and "how is" is not trending anymore BUT! if the user -for example- searches for "weather", so that will be considered totally as a different thing and not as a substring of a bigger meaningful search.
